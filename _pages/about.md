I am a research assistant in the [Vision for Robotics (V4R)](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/vision-for-robotics/) group of [Markus Vincze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8hxcuPoAAAAJ&hl=de) at the [Automation and Control Institute](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/) at TU Wien.
In my resarch, I focus on improving synthetic dataset generation, object detection and pose estimation for robotic applications such as robotic grasping.
