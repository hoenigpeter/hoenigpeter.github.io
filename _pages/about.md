I am a research assistant in the [Vision for Robotics (V4R)](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/vision-for-robotics/) group of [Markus Vincze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bdEbeaQAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao) at the [Automation and Control Institute](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/) at TU Wien.

My research focuses on bridging the gap between synthetic and real domains in object detection and pose estimation for robot vision. My goal is to enhance the reliability of robotic grasping, particularly for challenging materials like metallic and textureless objects, while promoting generalization beyond specific instances and potentially across categories.
